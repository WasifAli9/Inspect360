
Inspect360 is a PWA-first, AI-powered building inspection platform for Build-to-Rent (BTR) operations. It manages blocks, properties, inventories, inspections (check-in, routine, check-out), AI image analysis, AI comparison reports, compliance documents, and internal maintenance. It includes a tenant portal for logging/tracking requests and threaded discussions on comparison reports. Access is role-based with tailored dashboards for Owner Operator, Inventory Clerk, Compliance Officer, Contractor, and Tenant. Subscriptions are volume-based (inspection credits) using Stripe. Backend is Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage, Edge Functions, RLS). The app must be installable (PWA), work offline for field inspections, and sync images/notes when back online.
Primary user stories (MVP):
1.	Schedule inspections, assign to clerks, complete on mobile PWA with photos and offline mode, auto-raise maintenance items.
2.	Run AI analysis on photos and generate comparison reports (check-in vs check-out) with a liability suggestion for manager/tenant discussion.
3.	Track compliance docs (upload, expiry alerts), view dashboards per role, manage contacts with tags, and operate a tenant portal for maintenance requests.
4.	Enforce RLS so each role only sees what they should; block submissions when inspection credits are exhausted unless plan is upgraded.

Visual Design System (from logo)
Extracted palette from the supplied logo:
•	Navy: #003764 (brand primary)
•	Fresh Green: #59B677 (accent / success / CTA highlights)
•	Deep Blue: #000092 (secondary accent for emphasis/badges)
•	Black: #000000 (text on light backgrounds)
Use Navy for primary surfaces/components, Green for positive states and primary CTAs, Deep Blue for secondary CTAs or data accents. Prefer generous white/near-white backgrounds for readability and a clean, enterprise feel.
Tailwind theme extension (paste into tailwind.config.ts)
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        navy: '#003764',
        green: '#59B677',
        deep: '#000092',
        black: '#000000'
      },
      surface: {
        base: '#ffffff',
        muted: '#f6f8fa'
      }
    },
    boxShadow: {
      card: '0 6px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)'
    },
    borderRadius: {
      xl2: '1rem'
    }
  }
}
Global CSS variables (optional)
:root{
  --brand-navy:#003764;
  --brand-green:#59B677;
  --brand-deep:#000092;
  --text-strong:#000000;
  --bg:#ffffff;
  --bg-muted:#f6f8fa;
}
Component style guidance
•	Cards: white background, rounded-xl2, shadow-card, subtle borders on muted surfaces.
•	Primary Button: navy background, white text, hover: slightly darker navy; focus ring green.
•	Secondary Button: outline navy or deep blue; hover: tint fill.
•	CTA (Tenant / Submit): green background, white text, bold, short labels.
•	Inputs: large hit-areas, labels always visible, helpful text below.
•	Badges/Status: use deep blue for info, green for success, amber for warnings, red for critical.
•	Charts: single-color emphasis (deep blue) with green highlights for positives.
•	Icons: simple line icons; avoid clutter; use navy stroke.
Layout & Navigation
•	Left rail (persistent) with role-aware nav.
•	Top bar with search, quick actions (“New Inspection”), org switcher, user menu.
•	Content grid: responsive 12-col; cards snap to 4/6/12 spans.
•	Density: enterprise-light; ample whitespace; no cramped tables.
Accessibility & Motion
•	Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (navy/green on white is safe).
•	Focus rings visible (green).
•	Motion minimal; micro-transitions on hover/press.
•	Keyboard + screen-reader friendly (semantic headings, ARIA for status).

First-run Screens (copy this structure)
1.	Auth / Registration
o	Create organisation → invite team → connect Stripe (deferred)
2.	Role Select & Onboarding Checklist
o	Owner: “Add block → add properties → choose inventory template → invite clerks → create first schedule → set up Stripe.”
3.	Owner Dashboard
o	KPIs: credits used vs plan, inspections due today, expiring compliance, open maintenance, AI high-risk flags.
4.	Clerk “My Day” (PWA)
o	Assigned inspections, offline sync center, one-tap start, quick photo capture, condition/cleanliness sliders.
5.	Compliance Center
o	Expiring docs (30/60/90), upload flows, rule tracking.
6.	Tenant Portal
o	New request → track status → view comparison summary → comment thread.

Example UI microcopy (to keep tone consistent)
•	Primary CTA: “Start Inspection”, “Create Comparison”, “Log Maintenance”
•	Empty states: “No inspections today—schedule one or enjoy the calm.”
•	Alerts: “Inspection credits low – upgrade to avoid blocking submissions.”


Awesome—here’s a tight, “drop into Replit” description that gives the model full context and a clear UI brief using the logo colors.
