Replit Build Brief: Inspect360 Pricing + Stripe Setup (Eco-Admin + Add-Ons + Upgrades + Multi-Currency)
1) What we’re selling (keep it simple for customers)

Customers should only see two things:

A plan (monthly or annual) that includes a set number of AI inspections per month

Top-up bundles if they need more inspections (repeat purchase allowed)

Do NOT show tokens or photo maths. That’s internal.

2) Plans (what to create in Stripe Billing)
Plans and included inspections (per month)

Create these as Stripe Products with Prices in GBP, USD, AED, each with monthly and annual billing options.

Plan A — Freelancer

Included: 10 inspections/month

Price: £79/mo or £948/yr

USD: $99/mo or $1,188/yr

AED: 365 AED/mo or 4,380 AED/yr

Plan B — BTR / Lettings

Included: 50 inspections/month

Price: £349/mo or £4,188/yr

USD: $449/mo or $5,388/yr

AED: 1,650 AED/mo or 19,800 AED/yr

Plan C — PBSA

Included: 250 inspections/month

Price: £1,250/mo or £15,000/yr

USD: $1,590/mo or $19,080/yr

AED: 5,950 AED/mo or 71,400 AED/yr

Plan D — Housing Association

Included: 833 inspections/month (≈10,000/yr)

Price: £3,500/mo or £42,000/yr

USD: $4,450/mo or $53,400/yr

AED: 16,500 AED/mo or 198,000 AED/yr

Plan E — Council / Enterprise

Included: 2,083 inspections/month (≈25,000/yr)

Price: £6,250/mo or £75,000/yr

USD: $7,990/mo or $95,880/yr

AED: 29,500 AED/mo or 354,000 AED/yr

Important: These numbers are intentionally rounded and “budgetable.” Don’t try to do dynamic FX in public pricing.

3) Add-On Top-Up Bundles (repeat purchase)

These must be one-off purchases that can be bought repeatedly and immediately add inspection allowance to the account.

Top-Up bundles (apply instantly)

Top-ups are inspection credits (not tokens). They should be available to all customers.

Use tiered per-inspection pricing based on the customer’s plan:

Freelancer: £6 / inspection

BTR: £5 / inspection

PBSA: £4 / inspection

Housing Association: £3 / inspection

Council: £2 / inspection

Create three bundle products in Stripe (each with GBP/USD/AED prices). Prices below include a small bundle discount:

Bundle 100 inspections

Freelancer: £550 | $690 | AED 2,550

BTR: £450 | $590 | AED 2,100

PBSA: £360 | $470 | AED 1,700

HA: £270 | $350 | AED 1,250

Council: £180 | $240 | AED 850

Bundle 500 inspections

Freelancer: £2,650 | $3,350 | AED 12,250

BTR: £2,150 | $2,750 | AED 9,950

PBSA: £1,700 | $2,150 | AED 7,850

HA: £1,250 | $1,590 | AED 5,750

Council: £850 | $1,100 | AED 3,950

Bundle 1,000 inspections

Freelancer: £5,000 | $6,350 | AED 23,000

BTR: £4,000 | $5,100 | AED 18,400

PBSA: £3,100 | $3,950 | AED 14,250

HA: £2,250 | $2,850 | AED 10,350

Council: £1,500 | $1,900 | AED 6,900

Repeat purchase requirement

Implement top-ups as Stripe Checkout sessions (mode=payment) so customers can buy them again and again. After successful payment, webhook credits the account instantly.

4) Eco-Admin (multi-tenant) requirements

Inspect360 supports Eco-Admins. Each Eco-Admin must be able to define:

Which plans are available

Their plan pricing (GBP/USD/AED)

Their top-up pricing (GBP/USD/AED)

Whether they allow monthly, annual, or both

Optional discount % for annual

Stripe architecture

Each Eco-Admin should have their own Stripe account (Stripe Connect recommended).
Store at Eco-Admin level:

stripe_account_id

currency_default (GBP or USD or AED)

For every plan + currency + cadence: the Stripe Price ID

For every top-up bundle + currency: the Stripe Price ID

In the database, create tables like:

eco_admin_pricing_plans

eco_admin_pricing_topups

subscriptions

topup_purchases

billing_events

5) Subscription creation flow

When a customer selects a plan:

Create Stripe Checkout session (mode=subscription)

Use the correct Price ID for: plan + currency + monthly/annual

On success webhook:

Save stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id

Set account’s included inspections/month

Set account’s current plan tier

Reset monthly allowance counters on billing cycle

6) Upgrades / downgrades (must be simple)

In the app, add an “Upgrade plan” page.

Upgrade rules

Customer can move from any plan to a higher plan instantly

Stripe should prorate fairly

Implementation:

stripe.subscriptions.update(subscription_id, { items: [{id: subscription_item_id, price: new_price_id}], proration_behavior: "create_prorations" })

If moving from monthly to annual: create a new annual subscription OR update price with proration (whichever is cleaner with your current codebase)

Update the tenant plan in DB immediately after Stripe confirms success

Downgrades:

Allow downgrades but apply at end of billing period to avoid refunds and support hassle.

7) Cancellation (visible + requires reason)

Add a “Cancel subscription” button in the app.

Flow:

User clicks cancel

Show a modal:

“Why are you cancelling?” (radio list + optional text)

Options:

Too expensive

Missing features

Not using it enough

Switching provider

Support issues

Other (textbox)

Save cancellation reason to DB

Then call Stripe to cancel:

Default: cancel_at_period_end = true

Allow an “Cancel immediately” option only for admins (internal)

8) Past invoices and billing history

Add a “Billing & Invoices” page:

Show current plan, next billing date

List invoices with:

invoice date

amount

status

download link (PDF)

Implementation options (pick one and do it properly):

Stripe Customer Portal for invoices (fastest)

Or fetch via API: stripe.invoices.list({customer: stripe_customer_id})

Either way, user must be able to access past invoices.

9) Inspection slider (10 to 2000 per month)

On the pricing page, add a slider:

Min: 10

Max: 2000

Step: 10 (or 25; keep smooth)

Toggle: Monthly / Annual

Slider logic (no mental gymnastics)

Based on slider value, choose the nearest plan that covers it:

10–49 → Freelancer

50–249 → BTR / Lettings

250–832 → PBSA

833–2000 → Housing Association

2000 → Council/Enterprise “Book a demo”

The UI must show:

Recommended plan name

Included inspections

Monthly price

Annual price

CTA button: “Start free trial” or “Subscribe”

If user exceeds plan capacity and is near boundary, show:

“Need more than included? Add top-ups anytime.”

10) Webhooks (must be implemented)

Implement Stripe webhooks for:

checkout.session.completed (subscription + top-up payments)

invoice.paid (renewals)

customer.subscription.updated (upgrades/downgrades)

customer.subscription.deleted (cancelled)

invoice.payment_failed (lock features / notify)

Top-up payment webhook must:

Detect bundle purchased

Add inspections to balance immediately

Log transaction for audit

11) What “inspections balance” means in the app

Maintain three counters per tenant:

included_inspections_per_month (from plan)

used_inspections_this_month

topup_inspections_balance (rolls over until used)

Consumption logic:

Use included monthly allowance first

Then consume top-up balance

If both exhausted, block creation and show “Buy top-up” button
